# RDT-MQtt
## Initial prototypes and examples for NYURDT's usage of MQTT for the 2019 NASA RMC.
To use: start an MQTT broker (I use Mosquitto), run a receiver, run a publisher

For the CPP tests, install paho.mqtt.cpp following the instructions on github
For the python tests, install the paho.mqtt python library, again using github instructions
